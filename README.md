# Data_Sourcing_Challenge

Had issues using the code file provided by class. It seemed to be treating the file as if it was empty. Even though when it was downloaded all the code was there. The preview was the only part that was not working. You can see the original file saved under the "Old Code" file. Still reads "Unable to render code block." I copied over just the code and no Markdowns. This worked. The file is marked as V2 to show the difference.

Used Xpert Learning to help look up topics and how to implimnet. Also used it to help with some error codes. 
Everything esle is my own work.
